# SilverCoin
A space trade simulator

# Features
* Configurable production tree
* Configurable AI through behavioural trees (gdx-ai)

# Why?
I always wanted to do this; I don't know what the result will be - maybe
a programming game, maybe just a massive market simulation.

# TODO
* Make factory list scrollable.
* Introduce actual space actors (moving actors).
* Introduce multiple markets.
* Factories should accept buy orders directly instead of placing sell orders only.
* Introduce a script language (possibly LUA) to implement behaviour tree leaf tasks.
* Replace Resources class by libGDX AssetManager
