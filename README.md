# SilverCoin
A space trade simulator

# Why?
I always wanted to do this; I don't know what the result will be - maybe a programming game, maybe just a massive market simulation.

# TODO
* Introduce actual space actors (moving actors).
* Introduce multiple markets.
* Factories that cannot buy due to lacking sell offers should instead place a buy order.
* Rewrite JSON Parsing to use libGDX and proper JSON<->Class packing.
* Introduce a script language (possibly LUA) to implement Actor logic (makes it modable and easily extendible).

# Known Bugs
* Debugging reveals, that factories have inventory items with item=null.
